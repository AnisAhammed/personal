				 <h3>Different Types of Butterflies</h3>
	
	<p>Here are some of the butterflies you might find in your garden and quick guides to learn about the host plants you need to attract them.</p> 
	<p>As you plan your butterfly garden, determine which butterflies are native to your specific region. Some are found worldwide, while others are not.</p><hr/>

				<td>Anise Swallowtail<p>The Anise Swallowtail is a beautiful butterfly with a bright yellow and black coloring. But this butterfly gets it name from the fennel plant, also called wild anise, which is a common food source for the caterpillars. The caterpillars are often confused in appearance with the Black Swallowtail's caterpillars. Consider this butterfly when creating your own garden and you may soon see the Anise Swallowtail's gorgeous wings.<br/>
				Family: Swallowtail (Papilionidae)<br/>Subfamily: Swallowtail (Papilioninae)<br/>Average Wingspan: 2 3/4" - 3 1/2"<br/>Habitat: road edges, foothills, hillsides, gardens<br/>Similar To: Black Swallowtail</p></td>
				
				<td>Buckeye<p>Buckeye is a city in Maricopa County, Arizona, United States and is, at this time, the westernmost suburb in the Phoenix metropolitan area. The population was 6,537 at the 2000 census. From 2000 to 2010, the Buckeye population growth percentage was 678.3% as it had 50,876 people at the 2010 census.The tree species Aesculus glabra is commonly known as Ohio buckeye, American buckeye, or fetid buckeye. Glabra is one of 13–19 species of Aesculus also called horse chestnuts</p></td>
				
				<td>Cabbage White<p>Ahhh the common Cabbage White (Pieris rapae) butterfly a little butterfly that brings so much joy to young children despite its humble colouration and its cause of distress to farmers everywhere.The Cabbage White (Pieris rapae) is a small to medium (wingspan of 1 3/4" to 2 1/4") butterfly that is one of the first to be seen in the Spring. One of the reasons the larvae  of the Cabbage White or ‘Cabbage Butterfly’ are considered a pest is because its host plant is found in the Brassicaceae family, or those in the mustards! So, if you plant such crops as cabbage, turnips, cauliflower, radish, broccoli, watercress, then you might end up with some of the 'babies' of this butterfly.</p></td>

		</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td>Giant Swallowtail <p>The Giant Swallowtail (Heraclides cresphontes sometimes known as Papilio cresphontes) is a truly spectacular butterfly in the Parnassian (Papilionidae) family of butterflies. The Giant Swallowtail (name shortened to GST) is generally found from May through September in many parts of the United States but flutters about year-round in Florida and in the south. The upper-side is dark with a yellow chevron and the under-side is the yellow that just can't be described. It is a fairly large butterfly whose wingspan can reach from 4" to 6.25" and when you see one, you won't likely forget it!</p></td>
				
				<td>Gulf Fritillary <p>The Gulf Fritillary (Agraulis vanillae) is of the brush-foot or Nymphalidae family and its subfamily is the long-wings (Heliconiiae). It is a medium-sized butterfly whose wingspan is from 2.5" to 3.75". The upper-side is a bright reddish-orange with black veins and the underside is brownish with the most glorious iridescent silvery spots. Those silvery spots make it differ from the Monarch since Monarchs do not have those spots AND Monarchs are MUCH larger in size. This is a picture of a mating pair and you can see their silvery spots, and the beauty in the patterning</p></td>
				
				<td>Monarch <p>The Monarch (Danaus plexippus) is one of the most widely-recognized butterflies in the world. The fact that it makes an annual migration has mystified people for years and has been the impetus for scientists to study their behaviour and genetics. Interestingly enough, they are not the only butterfly that migrates, yet are probably the only one that has caught such public attention, perhaps due to its majestic presence in the sky. The Milkweed host plant contains a chemical called cardenolides which make the Monarch toxic to predators. Cardenolides are cardiac (heart) arresters and by ingesting the leaves of the Milkweed plant, the larva itself becomes toxic. </p></td>

			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td>Mourning Cloak <p>The Nymphalis antiopa, commonly known as the Mourning Cloak,  is one of the longest-lived butterflies in the world (up to ten months). It is in the brush-foot family (Nymphalidae family). Depending upon where you live or are from, you may know this butterfly as the Camberwell Beauty, or Mourningcloak,… It was given its name because it looked like it was wearing a dark cloak of mourning. With a wingspan of 2 1/4" to 4" the Mourning Cloak is in the medium- to large-sized category of lepidoptera. When their wings are closed up, they are a brownish-black colour, looking much like tree bark, and are easily camouflaged amongst the trees.</p></td>
				
				<td>Orange Sulphur <p>They're pretty much everywhere outdoors during the warm months -- orange sulphurs are one of the most common butterflies in North America. Colias eurytheme follows a typical life cycle pattern for butterflies, except for the efforts taken to avoid hybridization by crossing with the closely related yellow sulphur butterfly. An orange sulphur butterfly can mate and lay eggs several times during a summer breeding season. The male is responsible for initiating mating among Colias eurytheme. To do so, he emits pheremones to alert females to his presence.</p></td>
				
				<td>Painted Lady <p>
				The Painted Lady (Vanessa cardui) is commonly found around world-wide except on Antarctica and with limited range on Australia. It is also known as the 'Cosmopolitan' or 'Thistle' butterfly.  If you have ever purchased or received a butterfly ‘kit’ and its accompanying larvae (caterpillars)  then chances are, you are familiar with these darling little butterflies.

				The Vanessa cardui is a small- to medium-sized butterfly (wingspan no wider than about 2.875") in the Brush-foot (Nymphalidae) family. If you were to look at it closely, it appears to only have four legs because its first two are a bit smaller and are often not even noticeable.</p></td>

			</tr>
			
			<tr>
				<td>Queen <p>
				There’s more royalty in the butterfly world! The Queen (Danaus gilippus) is another of the 'Milkweed' butterflies. Sometimes mistaken for the Monarch, the Queen is a wee smaller in size with its noble orange-brown colouration edged in a black of two lines of white polka-dots. Like the Monarch, adult males can be easily distinguished by the small black scale patch on the hindwing.  If you look carefully at this Queen, you can see what looks almost like a white heart on the hindwing…this, when seen from the other side would indicate that this is a male.
				The Queen is another brush-footed butterfly in the Nymphalidae family. The wings reach from 2 5/8" to 3 7/8" wide, which classifies the Queen as a medium- to large-sized butterfly.</p></td>
				<td>West Coast Lady <p>The West Coast Lady (Vanessa annabella) is another member of the brush-foot butterfly family, the Nymphalidae. This one looks so much like the Painted Lady that if you don't look really carefully at the markings on the tips of the forewings OR at the blue dots on the hindwings, chances are you will think you are looking at a Painted Lady! This small-to-medium-sized butterfly (1 1/2" to 2 1/4") is found throughout the western and mid-western United States. It utilizes many of the same host plants as the Painted Lady (Vanessa cardui). So, if you have various plants in the mallow family (Malvaceae) which includes my favourite, the Lavatera maritima (tree mallow), then you just might find these beauties flying around. They also utilize Hollyhock (Althea), Checkerbloom (Sidalcea), and Bush mallow (Malvastrum) for host plants.</p></td>
				<td>Cloudless Sulphur <p>The cloudless sulphur, Phoebis sennae (Linnaeus), is one of our most common and attractive Florida butterflies and is particularly prominent during its fall southward migration. Its genus name is derived from Phoebe the sister of Apollo, a god of Greek and Roman mythology (Opler &nbsp; Krizek 1984). The specific epithet, sennae is for the genus Senna to which many of the cloudless sulphur's larval host plants belong. The cloudless sulphur is widspread in the southern United States, and it strays northward to Colorado, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana and New Jersey (Minno et al. 2005), and even into Canada (Riotte 1967). It is also found southward through South America to Argentina and in the West Indies (Heppner 2007).</p></td>
